# Welcome to System 98
"Welcome to Windows 98" re-created for web.

For now it's just a static screen :)

Made by hand using the power of HTML and CSS. Soon with some JS!

## Todo
- [ ] add menu hover support
- [ ] fill other screens with text
- [ ] find and add images for other screens
- [ ] put it all into a window
- [ ] reorder `.css` in a more sensible way
- [ ] make button and checkbox do somenthing
- [ ] maybe readjust the background
